Martin Luther King, Jr, needs no introduction. I am sure that every one must have heard of him in one context or other. 
But most of the people have forgotten what he said. I happen to listen to his famous speech [**"I Have a Dream"**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream). 
He talked about equality, freedom and justice. But what amazed me the most was that this phrase was not even there in his origional speech. 
His origional speech was titled <span class="highlight">**"Normalcy, Never Again."**</span>.
<br> 
But towards the end of the speech black American singer [**Mahalia Jackson**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson) shouted to Dr. King from the crowd, <span class="said-text">"Tell them about the dream, Martin."</span>. 
And he deviated from his origional speech. He started preaching, punctuating his points with **"I Have a Dream."**. And this speech went on to become the Top American Speech of the 20th century. 
This immediately reminded me of his famous saying:
<br>
>"Take the first step in faith. You donâ€™t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step."  
><cite> -- Martin Luther King, Jr</cite>

<br>
This made me wonder how correct his lines were. This will always inspire me. What ever the task may be just get on with it. Don't worry whether you will fail or pass, start the task.<br>
<br>
Another quote from Dr King. This one will break our heart.
>In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.  
><cite> -- Martin Luther King, Jr</cite>
