If you ask any Comuter Science student where they want to work, then the most common answer would be Google. Google is the preferd choice among freshers. If you are selected to work for google, then it is nothing but a dream come true. But most of the freshers do not know how to get there. I recently got a chance to sit for Google's Campus recruitment test. I thought that I must share my experience with all of you. This might help other people taking the exam in future.
I will tell you about the written exam that Google conducted at out college. First of all Google doesn't go to every college to conduct the exam. If Google conducts an exam at your college then here is how/what you should prepare. 

To begin with let me tell you that the exam is not tough. Atleast I didn't find it tough though it tests your skills. Questions will mostly be based on what you had learned during your B.Tech exam. The paper is roughly of 60-70 mins. Paper consists of 2 sections.  

1. Objective Multiple Choice Questions ( 15-20 questions )  
2. Subjective Programing Section ( 1-2 questions )  

Section 1 : MCQ
===========================
This sections consists of 15-20 multiple choice questions. There is negative marking in this section. Questions in this section are mostly based on the following topics:

Syllabus
----------------------------

1. Probability and Random Processes ( Mostly finding the expected value )  
2. Permutation & Combination  (Discrete Mathematics )  
3. C++/C Codes  ( Code was given and you had to find either the output or complexity )  
4. Algorithms  ( Finding the complexity of a variation of a know/famous algorithm )  
5. Formal Languages ( Questions based on Automata and Formal Language )  
6. Operating System  ( Questions on deadlock, fork(), pipelining, process queuing etc) 
7. Computer Architecture  ( Questions on block size, addressing, cache, etc)  

Section 2 : Programing
=========================
In the programing section you are given a problem and asked to write a code to solve that problem. You have to write code in either C, C++, or JAVA. No other language is allowes. If you were planning to write code in Python( like me) or Perl, or Ruby I suggest that you pick up a C++ book and start learning/revising. In this section thay will check your coding skills. You will be asked to write a neat, indented, and modular code, with proper naming conventions. You also have to give attention to the complexity of your algorithm. If you have been programing since the beginning of you B.Tech than this section won't be a problem. 


For practice I suggest that you have a look at previous year's papers. You can find them on various websites for example, [My Career Stack](http://mycareerstack.com), [Career Cup](http://careercup.com), etc. I suggest that you go to [My career Stack](http://mycareerstack.com) and have a look at google's exam papers from 2010 and 2011. This will help you a lot.
